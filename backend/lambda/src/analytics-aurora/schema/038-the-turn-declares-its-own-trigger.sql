-- 038: the turn takes its trigger from whichever row declared one
--
-- `trigger_kind` was read ONLY from the `placeholder_posted` row, and that row is null on every
-- turn in every deployment - so `COALESCE(trigger_kind, user)` collapsed every interaction into
-- one, the latency-by-interaction panel could only ever render a single row, and 037s own claim
-- that a rebuttal stays out of the Nielsen TTFF population has never once held.
--
-- WHY THAT ROW IS ALWAYS NULL, traced end to end:
--   * `placeholder_posted` is built from the CREATE event, and the ledger insert is
--     ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING - so whatever that row says at birth is final.
--   * the value is not knowable then. The placeholder is emitted through the Lex response path,
--     which sets no message Metadata at all, and the out-of-band analytics row that carries the
--     declared trigger is written AFTER the model call - keyed, on a broadcast resume, to the
--     answer rather than to the placeholder.
--
-- So the fact arrives late, and the fix is to let a later row supply it. The processor now stamps
-- `trigger` into the metadata of the placeholder UPDATE - a write that was already happening, so it
-- costs no extra call - and the ledger carries it through instead of nulling it. This view then
-- takes the turn`s trigger from whichever of its rows declared one.
--
-- It is still DECLARED rather than inferred: a row that says nothing contributes nothing, and no
-- guess is made from whether an exchange paired. That property is what 034 traded away and 037
-- restored, and it is not traded away here.
--
-- Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW, re-applied safely.
